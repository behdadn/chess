# Algorithmic chess engine

The code uses the [THC chess library](https://github.com/billforsternz/thc-chess-library) in order to facilitate movement of the pieces and board visualization in the backend. For the frontend, the website is built using Vue.js, and the actual chessboard on the website is rendered using [vue-chessboard](https://github.com/vitogit/vue-chessboard).
